== RFC 007: Community Notification Tags ==
We should implement a set of tags that users can post on any pathway, notifying the authors 
and the community about incomplete data or the status of the work.  These are analogous to 
the tags used in Wikipedia for the same purpose. Some of these could be very brief, others
could contain multiple sentences.

== TODO ==
1. Research how the tags are implemented at Wikipedia
2. Plan our implementation
3. Decide on levels of tags (some may be for admin only)
4. Decide on content
5. Implement


== Tag Brainstorm ==
Some ideas for tags:
  * In Progress, contact author ___
  * New Pathways
  * Recently edited
  * Hypothetical, not backed by published findings
  * Community Approved
