== Editing sections ==
It should be possible to edit section that contain only protect-tags that the
current user is allowed to edit.

=== Key change mechanism ===
Additionally we'll need a daemon/specialpage, which read all encrypted pages
and re-enciphers them using default (new) asymmetric key. 

== Translation ==
* errors translation
* group names translation when generating error page

== Other ==
* external program or a special page, which lists unused keys, which are safe to be removed
* external program or a special page, which re-encrypts pages encrypted by old keys
