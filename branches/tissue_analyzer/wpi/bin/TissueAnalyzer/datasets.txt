E-MTAB-2836	RNA-seq was performed of tissue samples from 122 human individuals representing 32 different tissues in order to study the human tissue transcriptome.This submission contains 27 new samples and the data from E-MTAB-1733.	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-2836">E-MTAB-2836</a> - RNA-seq of coding RNA from tissue samples of 122 human individuals representing 32 different tissues from the Human Protein Atlas project
E-MTAB-2919	RNA-seq from human tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project (http://www.gtexportal.org/home/)	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-2919">E-MTAB-2919</a> - RNA-seq from 53 human tissue samples from the Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) Project
E-MTAB-3358	This experiment captures the expression data reported by the RIKEN FANTOM5 project ( http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/ ), focusing on tissue/organism part data which was deposited in the seqence read archive (SRA) under study accssion DRP001031 ( https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/DRP001031 ). The samples in this experiment can also be found on a dedicated page of the FANTOM website: http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/sstar/Browse_samples. Since this is CAGE analsyis, gene expression data is reported by FANTOM5 in TPMs (tags per milliion) for gene promoters.	<a target="_blank" href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-3358">E-MTAB-3358</a> - RNA-Seq CAGE (Cap Analysis of Gene Expression) analysis of 56 human tissues in RIKEN FANTOM5 project
E-MTAB-3579	This experiment captures the expression data reported by the RIKEN FANTOM5 project ( http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/ ), focusing on mice tissue data which was deposited in the sequence read archive (SRA) under study accession DRP001032 (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/DRP001031 ).
