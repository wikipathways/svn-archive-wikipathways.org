== RFC 005: Reference pathways ==
This RFC describes the plan for keeping static, immutable reference pathways on WikiPathways. Since any pathway on WikiPathways is inherently 
unstable (meaning it's content will be changed by users), keeping an original reference pathway that is immutable is desirable for some 
pathway content, for example pathways converted from other sources (KEGG, Reactome, inter-species). 

== What is a reference pathway? ==

In the context of this RFC, a reference pathway is an automatically converted pathway, either from an outside source or from a different
species at WikiPatwhays. The content of the reference pathway would replicate completely that of the original pathway used for conversion.
The only possible difference in content would be introduced by the converter tool and would not involve the biology described in the pathway, 
but only cosmetic differences like changes to layout, fonts etc. 
A reference pathway cannot be edited by users.

== Implementation ==

=== Pathway ===

The reference pathway should be like any other pathway on WikiPathways in *almost* all aspects. The following lists of features/functions
is a first attempt at defining how the reference pathway is different.

The reference pathway should be different in terms of:
- Edits: Read-only, no edits allowed (See User interface Option 2)
- Pathway page (or the actual pathway image) should include a label or icon stating that it is a ref pathway.
- GPML: Somehow record that this is a reference pathway, source of the content and date it was retrieved

The reference pathway should behave like a normal pathway in terms of:
- Searching
- Browsing
- Pathway ontologies
- Pathway statistics
- Downloading
- Diff viewer (so that users an choose to compare an edited ref patwhay and the original)

=== Automatically updating reference pathways ===

One of the main benefits to keeping static reference pathways is that these can be automatically updated (programmatically) from the source 
without considering merging content with pathways generated from the ref pathway. Monthly (?) updates of reference pathways would ensure 
that our representation of outside content is kept up-to-date and accurate.
 
=== User interface ===

Option 1:
When a user tries to edit a ref pathway, the applet is started but when saving it will not be possible to save pathway with the
same name.

Option 2:
To edit a ref pathway a user first has to select "create new pathway" and an option for selecting a ref pathway as a starting point will
be available. If user tries to edit ref pathway directly, message appears explaining what to do.

These two options could also be combined in some way to provide greater usability.

AP: I think it would be better to block Option 1 altogether: the edit button should be disabled entirely.  If a user wants to download 
the pathway and edit it locally they can do that outside of WP. Option 2 is important for adapting reference pathways to create
specialized pathways.  This could be a general feature available whenever a new pathway is created. You can imagine and option to
start with an already existing pathway when creating a new pathway, and the reference pathways would be included in this list.  This
would also make it easier to manually translate a pathway from one species to another.

== Discussion points ==

=== Benefits of keeping reference pathways ===

- Reference pathways can easily be kept up-to-date with source without having to consider merging changes in pathways generated from reference 
pathway. This allows for accurate representation of outside content.

- User can compare pathways generated from a ref pathway to the original.

=== Drawbacks to keeping reference pathways ===

- Having several pathways with similar name and content may cause issues with pathway statistics. 

AP: Not sure why reference pathways would cause this?  Pathways with similar names can happen anyway and reference pathways shouldn't 
have more issues with this, I wouldn't think.
