Categorization of Pathways

GO vs GO-SLIM

Species: binary name system

We need to be able to specify pathways at levels lower than just species
(i.e. tissue type, maybe disease state)

Totally open attribute <-> value pairs?
Preselected attribute <-> values?
Predefined onthologies? Which ones?

There is a centralized, open source repository of biological ontologies at OLS
http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ontology-lookup/browse.do?ontName=PW
The link above goes to a Pathway Ontology we may consider (not sure of the source or the info).  
But, in addition, OLS has ontologies cell and tissue types, diseases, etc.
There are also ontologies available from OBO:
